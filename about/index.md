# About this project

This website is an active prototype, not a finished product.

The NSW government are currently testing different ways to improve the experience of people who are dealing with the death of someone close to them.

The information is not complete and should not be treated as formal or official advice about what to do when someone dies.

For more about prototyping and the alpha stage, see the Digital Transformation Agency's [service design guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/topics/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/).
