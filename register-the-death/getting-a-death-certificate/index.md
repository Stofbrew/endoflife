You can apply for a death certificate if you are:

* the next of kin named on the death certificate, i.e. current spouse (married/defacto), parent or child of the deceased
* the funeral director (within two months of the registration of death)
* the Executor of Estate
* the solicitor acting for next of kin or the Estate. For more information see our Factsheet for solicitors [PDF 170kb].
* If you are a relative not listed on the death certificate, the certificate can be issued to you if the deceased has no spouse, children or parents still alive.

## Extract death certificate
An extract death certificate is an official certified copy of part of the information held on the death register.  It can be issued with or without the cause of death.

The extract may not be accepted by some organisations due to the limited information it contains. To order an extract, please complete a death certificate application with a cover letter requesting an Extract death certificate.
