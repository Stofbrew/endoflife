## Medical certificate of cause of death
The medical certificate of cause of death is used to record how, where, and when a person has died. It is usually completed by a doctor in a hospital, and is then given to your funeral director.The funeral director will file this form when they register the death on your behalf.

If you are registering the death yourself, you will need to talk to the doctor or hospital where the death occurred.

If it’s not clear what has caused the death, the doctor cannot complete a medical certificate of cause of death. The doctor will refer the death If the refer the death to the Coroner.

When a death is referred to the Coroner, they will investigate the death. This can cause delays to cremation and burial.

## Registering the death of a stillborn child
A stillbirth which occurs in NSW is registered as a birth and contains a notation of the stillbirth. At the time of registration you also have the option to purchase a birth certificate. As a stillbirth is not registered as a death, the Registry cannot issue a death certificate.

If your baby died shortly after birth, you still need to register the birth of your child. You also have the option to purchase a birth certificate at this time. The funeral director will submit all relevant paperwork relating to the death and may make an application for the death certificate on your behalf.
