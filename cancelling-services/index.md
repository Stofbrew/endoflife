To change the deceased customer’s account and power supply, you need to be authorised to act on their behalf. You could be:

A primary or joint account holder on the account
An executor of the deceased’s estate
The deceased’s solicitor
A trustee or business partner of the deceased.
If you’re not the primary account holder, then providing some written evidence will help us to make those changes quickly.
