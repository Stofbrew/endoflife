A death certificate is used as an official record of a death. Your funeral director will often organise this for you, but it can only be issued after the funeral. It costs (x) and can take up to three weeks to arrive by mail.

<p> The extract may not be accepted by some organisations because it doesn't provide complete information. </p>

<p> To order an extract, please complete a death certificate application with a cover letter requesting an Extract death certificate. </p>
