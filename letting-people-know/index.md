# Getting a death certificate 

A death certificate is used to prove a death to services, organisations, and governments. Your funeral director will often organise this for you, but it can only be issued after the funeral. It can take up to three weeks to arrive by mail.

You can apply for a death certificate if you are:
- the next of kin named on the death certificate, i.e. current spouse (married/defacto), parent or child of the deceased
- the funeral director (within two months of the registration of death)
- the Executor of the estate
- the solicitor acting for next of kin or the Estate. For more information see our Factsheet for solicitors [PDF 170kb].

If you are a relative not listed on the death certificate, the certificate can be issued to you if the deceased has no spouse, children or parents still alive.
