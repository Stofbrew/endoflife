## Let authorities know

If the person died unexpectedly or in an accident, call 000.

If the person was in care when they died, contact their doctor or nurse.

Depending on how the person died, a doctor, nurse or coroner will examine the body and decide what happens next.

<!--   adapted from NZ content    -->

## Organise care of the body

The hospital or aged care facility will organise care of the body with your funeral director. This usually involves:  

* Transport of the body to a funeral home or house
* Storing the body before the funeral
* Preparing the body for cremation or burial

If you prefer, a funeral director will remove
the body from the home and care for it until
the funeral, burial or cremation. Most funeral
directors are available 24 hours, seven days a
week.
If you would like to make the funeral and
other arrangements yourself, ask the funeral
director if they will simply store the body
and transport it to the burial or cremation
location.

<!-- If you don't have a funeral director... I am uncertain that this is necessary in this content. Obviously there is some necessity to do this in the long term, but as such a small segment I don't think it's high-value -->


## Care for the body at home
You can keep the body for up to 5 days in your home.

If you want to keep the body in your home before the funeral, you will need to organise:

 * cooling plates for storing the body at home  
 * transport for the body to and from your home

 There are some strict requirements for how a body is cared for and transported.

 If you need help with this, talk to your funeral director.

 Care for the body at home
 You may want to keep your partner’s body at
 home for a few days. This time could help you
 to come to terms with the death, help with
 the grieving process, after-death care such as
 washing and clothing the body, holding a vigil,
 or waiting for family or friends to arrive.
 You can keep the your partner’s body at
 home for a few days provided it is kept cool;
 i.e. below 5 degrees centigrade.
 Some funeral directors can deliver cooling
 blankets to your home. Find out what is
 available in your area.

## Medical Certificate of Cause of Death

Usually, you won't have to organise the Medical certificate of cause of death – it will be organised by a doctor, and sent through to your funeral director automatically.
</p>

A Medical Certificate of Cause of Death is a document that states how a person has died. It's needed before a burial or cremation, and to register the death.

The Medical Certificate of Cause of Death can be completed by either the person's regular doctor, or a doctor that has treated them in hospital.

### If the death happened at home
If the death happened at home your doctor might have given you a certificate to complete yourself.

Contact the doctor that has given you this certificate - they will need to fill this out.

### If the death is referred to a coroner

This is slightly different.

## Locate the will

The will might tell you
* wishes for the funeral
* who might organise things
* steps to take relating house and assets
* where to find contact lists
