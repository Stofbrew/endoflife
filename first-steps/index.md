When someone dies, these are the things that need to be done right away.

## Let authorities know

If the person died unexpectedly or in an accident, call 000.

If the person was in care when they died, contact their doctor or nurse.

Depending on how the person died, a doctor, nurse or coroner will examine the body and decide what happens next.

## Organise care of the body

If you are using a funeral director, the hospital or aged care facility will organise care of the body with them. This usually involves:  

* Transport of the body to a funeral home or house
* Storing the body before the funeral
* Preparing the body for cremation or burial

Most funeral directors are available 24 hours, seven days a week.

If you would like to make the funeral and other arrangements yourself, ask the funeral director if they will simply store the body and transport it to the burial or cremation location.

~ <!-- If you don't have a funeral director... I am uncertain that this is necessary in this content. Obviously there is some necessity to do this in the long term, but as such a small segment I don't think it's high-value -->

## Care for the body at home

You can keep the body for up to 5 days in your home.

The body will need to be kept below 5 degrees Celsius, and will need to be transported by a professional.

If you would like to keep the body in your home before the funeral, you will need to organise:

 * cooling plates for storing the body at home  
 * transport for the body to and from your home


Not all funeral directors provide cooling blankets or transport to your home. For help with this, talk to your funeral director.

## Medical Certificate of Cause of Death

Usually, you won't have to organise the Medical certificate of cause of death â€“ it will be organised by a doctor, and sent through to your funeral director automatically.
</p>

A Medical Certificate of Cause of Death is a document that states how a person has died. It's needed before a burial or cremation, and to register the death.

The Medical Certificate of Cause of Death can be completed by either the person's regular doctor, or a doctor that has treated them in hospital.

### If the death happened at home
If the death happened at home your doctor might have given you a certificate to complete yourself.

Contact the doctor that has given you this certificate - they will need to fill this out.

### If the death is referred to a coroner

This is slightly different.

## Locate the will

The will might tell you
* wishes for the funeral
* who might organise things
* steps to take relating house and assets
* where to find contact lists
