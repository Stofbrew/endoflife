Time: Immediate

When someone dies, some things need to be done right away.

## Let authorities know

If the person was in care when they died or the death was  expected, call their doctor or nurse.

If the person died unexpectedly or in an accident, call 000.

Depending on how the person died, a doctor, nurse or coroner will examine the body and decide what happened.

<!--   adapted from NZ content    -->

## Organise care of the body

When someone dies, their body needs to be cared for.

This will be organised by the hospital and funeral director if you have one.

Transport of the body
Storage of the body
Preparation and care of the body

<!-- If you don't have a funeral director... I am uncertain that this is necessary in this content. Obviously there is some necessity to do this in the long term, but as such a small segment I don't think it's high-value -->


## At hospital, nursing homes, and other care


* medical certificate of cause of death
Assigned by doctor
Follows the body to funeral home
If referred to coroner, there are extra steps

## If the death happened at home

Your doctor might have given you a certificate to complete yourself.
Contact the doctor that has given you this certificate - they will need to fill this out.
Time frame? (It's my current understanding that this does not need to be immediate. At what point do you need to have the body transported?


## Keeping the body at home
You can keep the body for 5 days

If you want to keep the body in your home before the funeral, you will need
 * organise cooling plates
 * talk with the funeral director about Transport

## Locate the will

If there is a  will
The will might tell you
* wishes for the funeral
* who might organise things
* steps to take relating house and assets
* where to find contact lists
