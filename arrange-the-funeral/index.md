* funeral = held at any time before the burial or cremation where family and friends gather to farewell the dead
* memorial services = held at any time after the burial or cremation
* Wake = held immediately after the burial or cremation

### Funeral services at home
### Memorials, headstones, and family plots

Purchased plots
A person may purchase a burial plot from a cemetery before they die. The person does not legally own the burial plot. The purchaser of the burial plot, called the 'licence holder', purchases the right to be buried in the plot and may be able to nominate another person to also be buried in the same plot.

There are restrictions on the number of people that can be buried in a single plot and you should check with the cemetery before making any arrangements for burial. When the licence holder dies, the purchased plot becomes part of their estate. If there is no will, the next of kin becomes the holder of the burial licence.

A burial licence may be transferred to another person with the permission of the cemetery. You must contact the cemetery to find out their requirements to transfer the burial licence.

## Finding a cemetery or crematorium

Sometimes this is in the will. If it’s not on the will, generally this falls to the next of kin.

If the deceased had a will, the executor is responsible for arranging the funeral unless he or she decides to pass the responsibility to another family member.

“If the deceased did not have a will, or if no executor was appointed in the will, then the next of kin or close relative of the deceased can arrange the funeral.

If there is a dispute about who should arrange the funeral, you should get legal advice.” (LawAccess)

## What is a basic funeral
“What is a basic funeral?

A basic funeral is the lowest cost funeral service package the funeral director is able to provide. It consists of a single service, conducted at the funeral director’s premises or at the burial or cremation site. It would take place on a weekday between 8am and 5pm.

A basic funeral includes only the following:

* arrangement and conduct of the funeral
* transportation of the body to the funeral director’s premises, mortuary and
* burial or cremation site
* storage of the body at a mortuary or holding room
* preparation of the body for burial or cremation (does not include preparation for viewing or embalming)
* the least expensive coffin available
* compulsory medical certificates or permits
* burial or cremation of the body” (State Library of NSW– legal answers)
* Using a funeral director
* When does a funeral need to happen

## Funerals at home
If at home, the body can only stay with the family for 5 days.

[Bodies] must be refrigerated for 8 out of 24 hours. If you are planning for people to view [the body] at a ceremony in your home, make sure the funeral director knows what time this is happening so [the body] can be [displayed].

A funeral director may be able to help you with arrangements for care of the body at home.
When to hold the funeral
You can technically hold it whenever, depending on how long the funeral director is willing to store the body.

## Things that might delay a funeral

[Related: If the person is a veteran or is entitled to a military funeral]

## Cremation or burial
You cannot cremate someone who has made a written direction that they are not to be cremated. Any other directions about a funeral that a deceased person made in their will are not legally binding.

If you want to bury the deceased in a special way, for example without a coffin, you must contact the Local Health District Public Health Unit to ask permission before you bury the deceased.

Burials and cremations usually happen five to
ten days after death. However, you can do it
sooner (for example, for religious reasons) or
later (for example, to allow time for people to
travel from overseas). If you wish to keep the
body at home for a day or two, you may need
to hire a cold bed which will keep the body
cool.
