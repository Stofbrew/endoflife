# Arrange the funeral

Arranging a funeral involves making decisions about what kind of service, who's invited, deciding between cremation and burial, and permanent memorials. You will usually need to have your first conversation with a funeral directors or family about the funeral arrangements within 2 days after death.

In NSW, the average funeral costs around $4000. When organising the funeral, you will need to decide when to hold it, how to pay, memorial. Funeral directors help to organise most of the funeral arrangements.

See [Paying for a funeral](/endoflife/arrange-the-funeral/paying-for-a-funeral).

## Who is responsible

<!--

  Dark:   <p class="au-callout au-callout--dark">
-->

<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
  <p> The person who organises the funeral is responsible for paying for it. Before you sign documents with funeral directors, make sure you've requested a quote, and know how you are going to pay for the funeral. </a> 
</p>

If there is a Will, the executor is usually responsible for arranging the funeral, unless they decide to pass the responsibility to another family member.

If there is no Will or it's not stated, responsibility for the funeral often falls to the next of kin or a close relative.

If there is a dispute about who should arrange the funeral, get legal advice. 

<!-- "If the deceased did not have a will, or if no executor was appointed in the will, then the next of kin or close relative of the deceased can arrange the funeral.

If there is a dispute about who should arrange the funeral, you should get legal advice." (LawAccess) -->

## What's involved

* telling people 
* organising and giving speeches
* deciding between burial and cremation 
* choosing memorials 
* paying for the funeral 

## When to hold the funeral

You can technically hold it whenever, depending on how long the funeral director is willing to store the body.

Funerals, memorials and wakes
* funeral = held at any time before the burial or cremation where family and friends gather to farewell the dead
* memorial services = held at any time after the burial or cremation
* Wake = held immediately after the burial or cremation

### Things that might delay a funeral
- coronial inquiry 
- police inquiry 
- if death happened overseas 

## Holding a service at home

You might want to hold a service at a home. If at home, the body can only stay with the family for 5 days.

Bodies must be refrigerated for 8 out of 24 hours. If you are planning for people to view the body at a ceremony in your home, make sure the funeral director knows what time this is happening so they can arrange this.

Not all funeral directors offer memorial service at home. Check with your funeral director if they offer this service.

## Memorials, headstones, and family plots

A person may purchase a burial plot from a cemetery before they die. The person does not legally own the burial plot. The purchaser of the burial plot, called the 'licence holder', purchases the right to be buried in the plot and may be able to nominate another person to also be buried in the same plot.

There are restrictions on the number of people that can be buried in a single plot and you should check with the cemetery before making any arrangements for burial. When the licence holder dies, the purchased plot becomes part of their estate. If there is no will, the next of kin becomes the holder of the burial licence.

A burial licence may be transferred to another person with the permission of the cemetery. You must contact the cemetery to find out their requirements to transfer the burial licence.

## Cremation or burial

You cannot cremate someone who has made a written direction that they are not to be cremated. 

If you want to bury the deceased in a special way, for example without a coffin, you must contact the Local Health District Public Health Unit to ask permission before you bury the deceased.

Burials and cremations usually happen five to ten days after death. However, you can do it sooner (for example, for religious reasons) or later (for example, to allow time for people to travel from overseas). If you wish to keep the body at home for a day or two, you may need to hire a cold bed which will keep the body cool.
