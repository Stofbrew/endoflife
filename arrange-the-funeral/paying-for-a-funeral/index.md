# Paying for a funeral

A basic funeral costs around $5,000 and the person who organises the funeral will need to pay for it. To pay for a funeral you might use a pre-paid plan, insurance, a funeral bond. If you can't pay for the funeral or are in financial difficulty you might be able to get support.

## How much does a funeral cost?

In Australia, the cost of a basic funeral starts from around $5,000. The cost will be different depending on the kind of service you have and the funeral company you use. 

* A basic cremation costs about $4,000.
* A basic burial costs about $5,000; and in
addition you will need to pay for the burial
plot which costs from $2,600 to $15,500.

To find out exactly how much the funeral will cost, ask the funeral director for an itemised and written quote. In NSW, it's the law that funeral directors provide an itemised quote. 

Many funeral directors are part of the same company. When you are comparing prices, make sure that you are getting a real comparison between different companies.

Here are some of the costs to ask about:

* Funeral director fees
* Transport
* Coffin
* Death certificate
* Permits
* Burial/cremation
* Cemetary plot
* Other expenses, such as a celebrant or clergy, flowers, newspaper notices and the wake.

If you don't feel up to doing this yourself, ask a friend or family member to make the calls for you.

## Ways to pay for a funeral

As an executor or next of kin it is important that you check if the deceased had a funeral insurance plan.

Some people pay for their own funeral before they die. This is called a 'funeral plan'. There are different types of funeral plans, such as:

* Pre-paid funeral
* Funeral bond
* Funeral insurance

### Pre-paid funeral 
A pre-paid funeral is where a person plans their own funeral and pays for it with a funeral director of their choice. The funeral plan is a written contract which includes details of how the funeral will take place. The money is held in a funeral fund registered with NSW Department of Fair Trading. The money is paid directly to the funeral director after the funeral.

### Funeral bonds
A funeral bond is money invested by a person to pay for their own funeral. To pay for the bond, you usually pay a deposit then regular monthly instalments. There is a maximum contribution limit on funeral bonds. The current funeral bond limit is $12 500 (as at 1 July 2016). The bond can only be paid out after the person dies and the payout will be the value of the investment at the time.

### Funeral insurance
Funeral insurance involves a person making regular payments, called a 'premium, to an insurer. After the person dies the insurer pays a set amount of money to a nominated beneficiary. The beneficiary may then use this money to pay for the funeral.

For more information about different types of funeral plans, go to the NSW Department of Fair Trading website.

For information on funeral plans and paying for funerals for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, go to the ASIC website.

## If you can't pay for a funeral
If a person has no money or assets they are called 'destitute'. If a destitute person dies and there is no money to pay for a funeral, the government may pay for a funeral. This is called a 'destitute funeral.'

If the destitute person died in a Public Health Facility, like a hospital or nursing home, a social worker will usually contact relatives to ask whether they can arrange the funeral. The social worker may also ask police to assist with contacting relatives. If there is no relative willing to pay for the funeral, the social worker will usually arrange the funeral.

If the destitute person died outside hospital, their treating doctor and the police should be informed. The police can determine whether the person is destitute and will notify the Public Health Unit. An officer from the Public Health Unit will arrange the funeral.

Where a person's death is being investigated by the coroner, the coroner will ask the police to assist with determining whether the person is destitute and then will notify the Public Health Unit. An officer from the Public Health Unit will arrange the funeral.

The cost of a destitute funeral is paid by the Area Health Service and is a basic funeral service. The Area Health Service will contact the deceased's next of kin to let them know about the funeral arrangements so that relatives and friends can attend.

The person is usually cremated unless the deceased's next of kin or relatives refuse cremation. If the deceased is cremated, the next of kin is entitled to have the ashes of the deceased. If the deceased's next of kin requests a burial instead of cremation, the deceased will be buried in a common grave. The grave site is identified by a number with no other headstone.

## What is a basic funeral

A basic funeral is the lowest cost funeral service package the funeral director is able to provide. It consists of a single service, conducted at the funeral director’s premises or at the burial or cremation site. It would take place on a weekday between 8am and 5pm.

A basic funeral includes only the following:

* arrangement and conduct of the funeral
* transportation of the body to the funeral director’s premises, mortuary and
* burial or cremation site
* storage of the body at a mortuary or holding room
* preparation of the body for burial or cremation (does not include preparation for viewing or embalming)
* the least expensive coffin available
* compulsory medical certificates or permits
* burial or cremation of the body" (State Library of NSW– legal answers)
* Using a funeral director
* When does a funeral need to happen

## Getting help with funeral costs
If you are paying for a partner's funeral, their bank may be able to release money from their account to help pay funeral expenses before 'probate' is granted (that is, before the court validates their will).

If you think your partner had a funeral bond or made pre-paid funeral arrangements but you can't find the paperwork, check with your solicitor or the executor of the estate. Some private health and life insurance policies, which are sometimes held through superannuation funds, also pay some funeral costs. Read about super death benefits.

Some organisations can help with the cost of a funeral. Contact the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) on 13 32 54 (1800 555 254 for regional callers) about how it can help support you through deaths and funerals.

A bereavement payment may be available through the Department of Human Services. See their webpage on what to do following a death or call 13 23 00 (1800 810 586 for TTY service).
