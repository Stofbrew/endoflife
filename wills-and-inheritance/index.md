# Wills and inheritance

##  What is a Will?

A Will is a legal document that clearly sets out your wishes for the distribution of your assets after your death. Having a clear, legally valid and up-to-date Will is the best way to help ensure that your assets are protected and distributed according to your wishes.

Studies show that on average 45% of Australians do not have a current Will. If you die without a Will no-one knows who you wanted as your beneficiaries, or who you wanted as your executor (the person or organisation you nominate to administer your estate upon your death). Your assets will be distributed according to a set formula with certain relatives receiving a defined percentage of your assets, despite what you may have wished.

Your Will is probably the most important document you will ever sign, so it’s advisable that you have it prepared by an expert who is supported by accountants, taxation, investment and legal professionals such as those we have on staff at NSW Trustee & Guardian.

## I have been appointed executor what should I do?
Many people see it as a compliment to appoint a friend or relation as their executor. However, the majority of people when nominated as an executor are unsure of what is expected of them and this can lead to mistakes being made and the executor being held liable. In many instances the work involved is complex and time consuming requiring knowledge of law, accounting and taxation requirements. All estates are not alike and can differ for a number of reasons. An estate may be administered and distributed according to a Will or, if there is no Will, according to a legal formula which specifies who will receive the proceeds of the estate.
Steps that an executor needs to take:

* Locate Will
* Make funeral arrangements if required
* Preliminary conference with family and business associates
* Advise beneficiaries and ascertain immediate needs of the family
* Protect assests: protect business interests, collect valuables and income, insure all property, keep surplus funds invested
* Determine assets and debts, prepare statement thereof. Assets may include personal effects, securities, real estate, property outside NSW, cash, business interests. Liabilities may include debts due and debts owing.
* Apply to Supreme Court for a grant of Probate and attend to legal formalities - realise assets to pay liabilities including income tax to date of death and prepare accounting and tax information for beneficiaries
* Distribution of Estate
* Establishment of Trusts - pay legacies and hand over specific bequests, transfer funds or assets to beneficiaries, obtain receipts, prepare final statement for beneficiaries
* Continuing administration and asset management if required e.g. to manage longer term trusts

## How long will administration of estate likely to take?
The time taken to administer an estate varies widely and is dependent on the complexity of the estate, as well as additional factors such as how long it takes to realise (sell assets) such as real estate, if anyone contests the Will, and locating missing beneficiaries.   

Being an executor even for a simple estate can take a considerable amount of time. Due to legislative changes in the Succession Act 2006, the minimum time to finalise an estate is 6 months from the date of death.  If you as the executor distribute the estate before this time you are not protected if claims are made against the estate. However, most estates are finalised within 9-12 months. If there are difficulties locating beneficiaries, challenges to the Will or the estate involves setting up trusts for minors or life interests, the duties of the executor may take several years.

## What is probate?
As an executor you will need to apply for Probate. Probate is essentially official recognition that a Will is legally valid and gives permission to proceed with administering the estate. An application is made to the Probate Registry of the Supreme Court for a Grant of Probate. The grant is a document certifying that the Supreme Court recognises the authority of the executor(s) to deal with the estate. This will enable you to administer the Will (collect the assets and pay any debts of the deceased person and then to distribute the estate as directed).

A Grant of Probate is necessary to ensure that the person seeking the release of assets has the authority to do so. Therefore banks and other asset holders such as insurance companies, and superannuation funds generally require Probate before releasing or transferring assets. A Grant of Probate is also necessary if real estate is to be transferred or sold.

## Online probate notices
There are three notices relevant to deceased estates in NSW that should be published online via the NSW Online Registry.
These notices are:

* Notice of intended application for probate, administration or reseal
* Notice of intended distribution of an estate
* Notice of filing of accounts

## How long does probate take to process?

Curren​t processing times for probate applicat​​ions​​*

The Court's processing times** for probate applications are as follows:

Non complex applications including applications for a grant of probate, administration or administration with the will annexed, or for a reseal of a grant: up to 10 working days from date of filing, or receipt of additional information. These delays are due to the high number of applications received and the availability of Registrars to assess the applications.

Complex applications may take additional time to be considered. Complex matters include (but are not limited to) matters involving informal wills, copies of wills, presumption of death, limited purpose grants, or administration applications not being made by the next of kin.
The current delay* in the processing of Exemplifications is 30 ​working days from date of filing, or receipt of additional information.  

^This information is updated on a regular basis: ​​​Current delays as at week commencing 05 November 2018.​

^^The processing time is the number of working days between the date the application was filed and either the Court issues the grant/letters of administration, or requests further information from the applicant or his/her lawyer. ​
