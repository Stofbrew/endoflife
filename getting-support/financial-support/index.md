## Getting bereavement payments

### If you are a carer
Carer payment recipients retain their pension for 14 weeks after the death of a pensioner in their care. They may also be entitled to a lump sum payment.

### If death of child
If a person was receiving Family Tax Benefit instalments for a child who has died, the Family Tax Benefit will continue for 14 weeks from the date of the child’s death. This can be paid as a lump sum or fortnightly instalments.

People not receiving Family Tax Benefit instalments for a child, but who may have been eligible for Family Tax Benefit, may receive a lump sum Bereavement Payment of Family Tax Benefit. Baby Bonus and Maternity Immunisation Allowance may also be payable for a young child.

### If death of partner
A person with no dependent children whose spouse dies receives a bereavement allowance if they are not already receiving a pension or benefit. If they can satisfy the requirements of the normal pension assets and income tests, the allowance is payable for 14 weeks after the death of the spouse.

Bereavement payments also apply where one member of a couple is a pensioner and their partner has been receiving an allowance for at least 12 months.

### If a veteran
The surviving partner of a veteran who received a service pension is eligible for a lump sum bereavement payment equivalent to six fortnightly payments of the combined partnered rate service pension the couple were paid, less the surviving partner’s new single rate of pension. A funeral benefit of up to $2000 can be paid to assist with the funeral costs of an eligible veteran or dependant. A veteran surviving their partner receives the same payment in transition to the single pension rate.

In the case of a veteran who receives a disability pension, the bereavement payment is the equivalent of six pension instalments, at the rate paid before death or at the general rate, whichever is less.

Bereavement payments are not made following the death of a single disability pensioner. Their estate receives one extra payment of the service pension. A war widow’s pension ceases at the recipient’s death.

In cases of financial hardship, extra financial assistance may be available for funeral expenses in certain circumstances. Each case is individually assessed. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs can provide more information.

## Help paying for the funeral
### Funeral grants for Aboriginal people in NSW
The New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC) offers Land Council members, and Aboriginal people resident in New South Wales financial grants under a Community Benefits Scheme.

The NSWALC offers two types of grants to help with funeral costs:
* $5000 – for any person who was a member of the NSWALC Funeral Fund from 1991–1994.
* $1000 – for any NSW Aboriginal person being buried in NSW.

These grants are paid directly to service providers.

For a complete list of criteria, see the [Terms and Conditions 306KB PDF](http://alc.org.au/media/138935/180608%20-%202018%20funeral%20grants%20terms%20and%20conditions.pdf).

### Insurance: motor vehical accidents
Relatives of a person who dies in a motor vehicle accident where the driver was not at fault should seek legal advice as to their rights. In such cases, relatives are entitled to claim funeral expenses from the other driver’s insurance company.

### Pensioner associations and registered clubs
Some associations and clubs, such as the Returned and Services League (RSL), may pay a small funeral benefit for members or people who need assistance following bereavement. You can apply to individual organisations to find out if you qualify.

### Trade unions
It is worth inquiring if the union to which the deceased belonged will provide any benefits.

### Health insurance schemes
Some health insurance schemes cover funeral benefits. The deceased person’s policy should be checked or the health insurance company contacted.

### Voluntary agencies
In some circumstances, agencies such as St Vincent de Paul or Anglicare may assist in a small way, or refer people to a funeral director prepared to discount the costs.

### Financial institutions
Banks may lend money to pay funeral costs. An application for a loan would be considered on its merits, and commercial interest rates would apply. People who apply for a loan need to know:

* the precise rate of interest to be paid
* exactly how much will have to be paid back
* over what period of time the loan will continue.
