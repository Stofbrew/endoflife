# After a death 
When someone dies, there can be pressure to make big decisions quickly. This guide gives you information to help make choices that are right for your situation.

On this page: 
- [1. First steps - day 1-3](#1.)
- [2. Organise a funeral - first week](#2.)
- [3. Get support - first month](#3.)
- [4. Get a death certificate - after the funeral](#4.)
- [5. Cancel services - months 1-3](#5.)
- [6. Execute the will - months 1-12](#6.)

## 1. First steps - day 1-3 


In the first days after someone dies you might need to: 
- let [authorities know](http://www.lawaccess.nsw.gov.au/Pages/representing/after_someone_dies/who_do_you_notify_after_someone_dies/who_do_you_notify_after_someone_dies.aspx)  
- talk to a [funeral director](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/buying-products-and-services/buying-services/funerals/using-a-funeral-director)
- find the will and other documents 
- consider [time off work](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/compassionate-and-bereavement-leave) 
- care for dependants
- care for pets
- let family and friends know

In some circumstances you will need to take extra steps. This is common if the death:  
- [happened overseas – SmartTraveller](https://smartraveller.gov.au/guide/all-travellers/birth-death-marriage/Pages/death-overseas.aspx) 
- [happened in another state or territory](link) 
- [was a still birth](link) 
- [was unexpected, accidental, or suspicious](linktocoroner)

 
## 2. Organise a funeral or memorial service – first week 

<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
The person who organises the funeral is responsible for paying for it. Before you sign documents with funeral directors, make sure you've requested a written quote, and know how you are going to pay for the funeral.
</p>

A funeral or memorial service usually happens between 1 and 4 weeks after someone dies. 

Every funeral is different, and when organising a funeral there are many things to consider. Using a funeral director can help to make this easier. They will help you with:
- organising the service including speeches 
- transporting and caring for the person who has died
- organising a venue for the service 
- officiating/speaking at the funeral

</a>
### Things to consider when organising a service

When organising a funeral, you will have to decide on: 
- where the burial plot or memorial will be
- whether burial or cremation 
- what kind of coffin 
- the date (particularly important if people are travelling from far away)
- who will speak at the service 
- what to say at the service
- who to invite to the service 
- what clothing you would like the person to wear
- what is in the memorial booklet 
- whehter you want to hold a wake 

### Paying for a funeral 

<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
In NSW, a funeral director is required to give you a written quote for a basic funeral. A basic funeral in NSW costs, on average, $4000. 
</p>

You can pay for a funeral in many different ways:
- funeral insurance (kept with an insurance agency)
- using funds from a prepaid funerals (kept with a funeral home)
- the person's estate (as stipulated in the Will)
- from your own funds

[More about these ways to pay for a funeral at LawAccess NSW](http://www.lawaccess.nsw.gov.au/Pages/representing/after_someone_dies/funerals/paying_for_the_funeral.aspx)

If you or the person's estate can’t pay for a funeral, they may be eligible for a  destitute funeral. In a destitute funeral, the government covers the cost of a basic funeral.

## 3. Get support – first month 

### Getting support for grief 

When someone close to you dies, it can help to have someone to talk to. 

Some of the support services you might consider include: 

* counselling services
* grief counsellor
* social worker
* online services
* support groups
* support services for children

For a list of services close to you, see the [National Associationg for Loss and Grief) (http://www.nalag.org.au/). 

Medicare subsidises some of the cost for counselling services and social work. For more information about Medicare subsidies for grief support, see the [Health Direct](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/mental-health-care-plan). 

If you are receiving a Centrelink payment, you can access some services for free. For information on free services, see the [Department of Human Services](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/subjects/what-do-following-death#a7).

### Getting financial support 
Some people can get help to pay for living expenses and funeral costs.  

Check if you are eligible for the following financial support: 
- [widows](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/bereavement-allowance/who-can-get-it) 
- [veterans](http://www.dva.gov.au/benefits-and-payments/bereavement-assistance)
- [carers](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/bereavement-payment)

- [parents of a stillborn child](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/stillborn-baby-payment)
- [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders - Transport for NSW](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/operations/community-transport-operators/transport-for-aboriginal-communities) 

If you are seeing a counsellor as part of a mental health care plan, or if you are recieving a Centrelink payment, you may be eligible for subsidies for seeing mental health professionals. For more information. 

If you are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander, you might be able to get refunds for travel to funerals. See [Transport for NSW](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/operations/community-transport-operators/transport-for-aboriginal-communities)


## 4. Get a death certificate – after the funeral
A death certificate is the official record of a person's death. It can be used to prove that a death has occurred, which is important when you are:
- cancelling and transferring services 
- executing a will 
- making an insurance claim 
- claiming superannuation. 

You funeral directors will usually submit the forms required to get a death certificate, and the certificate will be sent to you through the mail. Because a death certificate records where someone is buried or cremated, you can't get a death certificate until after the funeral.

You can request a death certificate online, in person, or through the post. Visit [NSW Births, Deaths, and Marriages](https://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/deaths/death-certificate.aspx#Howtoapply) for more information. 

Births, Deaths and Marriages charge $85 for a death certificate. They can take up to three weeks to arrive, depending on how you apply. For more information about getting a death certificate, visit [Births, Deaths, and Marriages](https://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/deaths/death-certificate.aspx#Identification). 

## 5. Cancel or transfer services – after the funeral

To cancel most services you will need a certified copy of the death certificate, account details, and to meet with the service face to face. If you want to transfer the services to your name, you will also need to prove your identity.

Cancelling services can take a long time.

Many services will ask you to meet with them in person. 
See more about cancelling:
- Bank accounts 
- Memberships 
- Phone, internet, electricity, gas
- Social media accounts 
- Licences and registration 

For a checklist of services to contact, see the [Department of Human Services - PDF](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/who-to-notify-checklist.pdf). 

### Certifying copies 
To cancel or transfer ownership of a service, many companies will need a 'certified copy'. 

A certified copy is a photocopy of a document that has been seen by a Justice of the Peace (JP) alongsidewith the original document. 

Because you might be cancelling many services, consider getting many copies certified by the JP at the same time.

## 6. Execute the Will – 1-12 months

A Will is a legal document that states your wishes for how your assets will be distributed after your death. 

If there are assets that need to be distributed to many different parties, executing a Will can take a long time. 

Depending on the size and nature of the estate, the process of executing a Will can involve: 
- Finding the Will
- Talking to family and business associates
- Telling beneficiaries 
- Protecting assests, listing assets and debts 
- Applying to Supreme Court for a grant of Probate 
- Paying any liabilities including income tax to date of death with assets. 
- Preparing accounting and tax information for beneficiaries
- Distribution of Estate
- Establishment of Trusts - pay legacies and hand over specific bequests, transfer funds or assets to beneficiaries, obtain receipts, prepare final statement for beneficiaries
- Continuing administration and asset management if required e.g. to manage longer term trusts

For more complete information about Wills in NSW, see [Trustee and Guardian](https://www.tag.nsw.gov.au/wills-landing-page.html)

### Intestacy: If there isn't a will
<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
 Looking after a person's assets if they don't have a Will can be complicated. For complete information on what happens if there isn't a Will, see <a href="https://www.tag.nsw.gov.au/intestacy-faq.html">NSW Trustee and Guardian</a>. 
</p>

If someone dies without a Will they are said to die 'intestate'. Intestacy can also include the following situations: 
- the Will doesn't properly dispose of all assets
- the Will is either not signed or not witnessed  
- the person did not have mental capacity to make a Will
- the Will has not been written in a way that meets the legal rules for Wills

Sometimes a person may die partly testate and partly intestate. This occurs where part of the Will is valid but part is invalid. This may result in even more inconvenience, delay and expense than administering a full intestate estate.
