What to do after a death
===========================

In New South Wales, what you need to do after a death will be different depending on:

* if there is a will
* if there are children or dependents
* whether you are receiving government benefits
* whether the death happens at home or in care
* if you are the executor or next of kin

You'll need to do some things right away, but other things can wait until after the funeral.

This guide provides you with a checklist of what to do after someone dies.

### [What to do immediately after someone dies](first-steps)

Who to contact, what happens with the body, and what happens if there are dependents.
