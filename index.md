In New South Wales, what you need to do after a death will be different depending on:

* if there is a will
* if there are children or dependents
* whether you are receiving government benefits
* whether the death happens at home or in care
* if you are the executor or next of kin

You'll need to do some things right away, but other things can wait until after the funeral.

This guide provides you with a checklist of what to do after someone dies.

### [What to do immediately after someone dies](first-steps)

Who to contact, what happens with the body, and what happens if there are dependents.

### [Get a death certificate](register-the-death/getting-a-death-certificate)

What you need to get a death certificate, how to do it, how long it will take, and what you can use a death certificate for.

### [Register the death](register-the-death)

Usually your funeral director will register the death for you. If you are the next-of-kin or a relative, you can register the death yourself.

### [Get financial help](getting-support/financial-support)

Help with Centrelink payments, paying for the funeral, and paid leave from work.

### [Wills and inheritance](wills-and-inheritance)

What to do with the will, finding beneficiaries, getting a lawyer, and tax.
