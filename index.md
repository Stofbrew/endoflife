When someone dies, there can be pressure to make big decisions quickly. This guide gives you information to help make choices that are right for your situation.

On this page: 
- [1. First steps - day 1-3](#1.)
- [2. Organise a funeral - first week](#2.)
- [3. Get support - first month](#3.)
- [4. Get a death certificate - after the funeral](#4.)
- [5. Cancel services - months 1-3](#5.)
- [6. Execute the will - months 1-12](#6.)

## 1. First steps - day 1-3 

In the first couple of days after someone dies you might need to: 
- let authorities know 
- talk to a funeral director 
- find the will and other documents 
- consider time off work 
- let family and friends know

In some circumstances you will need to take extra steps. This is common if the death:  
- [happened overseas](link) 
- [happened in another state or territory](link) 
- [was a still birth](link) 
- [was referred to the coroner](link) 

 
## 2. Organise a funeral or memorial service – first week 

In the first week after someone dies you will likely have to organise the funeral or memorial service. 

Every funeral is different, and when organising a funeral there are many things to consider. Using a funeral director can help to make this easier. They will help you with:
- organising the service including speeches 
- transporting and caring for the person who has died
- organising a venue for the service 
- officiating/speaking at the funeral 

Common decisions include: 
- where the burial plot or memorial will be
- whether burial or cremation 
- what kind of coffin 
- who will speak at the service 
- what to say at the service
- who to invite to the service 
- what clothing you would like the person to wear 
- the memorial booklet 
- organising a wake 

In NSW, a funeral director is required to give you a written quote for a basic funeral. A basic funeral in NSW costs, on average, $4000. 

You can pay for a funeral in many different ways:
- funeral insurance
- prepaid funerals
- up front
- the person's estate

If you or the person's estate can’t pay for a funeral, they may be eligible for a  destitute funeral. In a destitute funeral, the government covers the cost of a basic funeral. [More about destitute funerals] (destitute funerals link)  

## 3. Get support – first month 

### Getting support for grief 

After someone dies, people often find it helpful to talk to someone. 

Some of the support services you can use include: 
* counselling services
* grief counsellor
* social worker
* online services
* support groups
* support services for children

Many of these are subsidised by Medicare. If you are receiving a Centrelink payment, you can access some services for free. 
For a list of services close to you, see the [service locator] link. 

### Getting financial support 
There are 
- subsidies for counselling through mental health care plan 
- financial support for widows 
- financial support for veterans 
- financial support for new parents 
- financial support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders  (funerals, transport)

If you are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander, you might be able to get support to pay for the funeral. See [this link](link location)

## 4. Get a death certificate – after the funeral
Death certificates are used for a whole host of things – cancelling and transferring services, family history. A death certificate is the official record of a persons death. 

These are the requirements for a death certificate: 
- you must be next of kin or executor of the estate(ID) 
- it must be after the funeral 

Births, Deaths and Marriages charge $x for a death certificate. They take [up to three weeks] to arrive. For more information about death certificates, visit [Births, Deaths, and Marriages] (link). 

## 5. Cancel or transfer services – after the funeral

Cancelling services can take a long time

Make sure you get a whole heap of copies of the death certificate, as many services will need a certified copy (a copy that is signed off by a Justice of the Peace [link]) to cancel or transfer services. 

Many services will ask you to meet with them in person.
