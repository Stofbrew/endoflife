# After a death 
When someone dies, there can be pressure to make big decisions quickly. This guide gives you information to help make choices that are right for your situation.

On this page: 
- [1. First steps - day 1-3](#1.)
- [2. Organise a funeral - first week](#2.)
- [3. Get support - first month](#3.)
- [4. Get a death certificate - after the funeral](#4.)
- [5. Cancel services - months 1-3](#5.)
- [6. Execute the will - months 1-12](#6.)

## 1. First steps - day 1-3 


In the first days after someone dies you might need to: 
- let authorities know 
- talk to a funeral director 
- find the will and other documents 
- consider time off work 
- care for pets and dependants
- let family and friends know

In some circumstances you will need to take extra steps. This is common if the death:  
- [happened overseas](link) 
- [happened in another state or territory](link) 
- [was a still birth](link) 
- [was unexpected, accidental, or suspicious](linktocoroner)

 
## 2. Organise a funeral or memorial service – first week 

<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
The person who organises the funeral is responsible for paying for it. Before you sign documents with funeral directors, make sure you've requested a written quote, and know how you are going to pay for the funeral.
</p>

A funeral or memorial service usually happens between 1 and 4 weeks after someone dies. 

Every funeral is different, and when organising a funeral there are many things to consider. Using a funeral director can help to make this easier. They will help you with:
- organising the service including speeches 
- transporting and caring for the person who has died
- organising a venue for the service 
- officiating/speaking at the funeral 

### Things to consider when organising a service

When organising a funeral, you will have to decide on: 
- where the burial plot or memorial will be
- whether burial or cremation 
- what kind of coffin 
- the date (particularly important if people are travelling from far away)
- who will speak at the service 
- what to say at the service
- who to invite to the service 
- what clothing you would like the person to wear
- what is in the memorial booklet 
- whehter you want to hold a wake 

### Paying for a funeral 

<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
In NSW, a funeral director is required to give you a written quote for a basic funeral. A basic funeral in NSW costs, on average, $4000. 
</p>

You can pay for a funeral in many different ways:
- funeral insurance (kept with an insurance agency)
- using funds from a prepaid funerals (kept with a funeral home)
- the person's estate (as stipulated in the Will)
- from your own funds

If you or the person's estate can’t pay for a funeral, they may be eligible for a  destitute funeral. In a destitute funeral, the government covers the cost of a basic funeral. [More about destitute funerals](destitute–funerals-link)  

## 3. Get support – first month 

### Getting support for grief 

When they are grieving it can be helpful to talk to someone. 

Some of the support services you can use include: 
* counselling services
* grief counsellor
* social worker
* online services
* support groups
* support services for children

For a list of services close to you, see the [service locator](link). 

Medicare subsidises some of the cost for counselling services and social work. For more information about Medicare subsidies for grief support, see the [Medicare website](medicare link). 

If you are receiving a Centrelink payment, you can access some services for free. For information on free services, see the [Department of Human Services](DHS link).

### Getting financial support 
Some people can get help to pay for living expenses and funeral costs.  
Check if you are eligible for the following financial support: 
- [widows](link) 
- [veterans](link)
- [new parents(link)
- [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders(link) (funerals, transport)

If you are seeing a counsellor as part of a mental health care plan, or if you are recieving a Centrelink payment, you may be eligible for subsidies for seeing mental health professionals. For more information. 

If you are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander, you might be able to get support to pay for the funeral. See [this link](link location)


## 4. Get a death certificate – after the funeral
A death certificate is the official record of a person's death. It can be used to prove that a death has occurred, which is important when you are:
- cancelling and transferring services 
- executing a will 
- making an insurance claim 
- claiming superannuation. 

You funeral directors will usually submit the forms required to get a death certificate, and the certificate will be sent to you through the mail. Because a death certificate records where someone is buried or cremated, you can't get a death certificate until after the funeral.

You can request a death certificate online through [Births, Deaths, and Marriages.](bdm link)

Births, Deaths and Marriages charge $x for a death certificate. They take [up to three weeks] to arrive. For more information about death certificates, visit [Births, Deaths, and Marriages] (link). 

## 5. Cancel or transfer services – after the funeral

To cancel most services you will need a certified copy of the death certificate, account details, and to meet with the service face to face. If you want to transfer the services to your name, you will also need to prove your identity.

Cancelling services can take a long time.

Many services will ask you to meet with them in person. 
See more about cancelling:
- Bank accounts 
- Memberships 
- Phone, internet, electricity, gas
- Social media accounts 
- Licences and registration 

For a checklist of services to contact, see the [Department of Human Services](linktochecklist). 

### Certifying copies 
To cancel or transfer ownership of a service, many companies will need a 'certified copy'. 

A certified copy is a photocopy of a document that has been seen by a Justice of the Peace (JP) alongsidewith the original document. 

Because you might be cancelling many services, consider getting many copies certified by the JP at the same time.

## 6. Execute the Will – first months 

A Will is a legal document that states your wishes for how your assets will be distributed after your death. 

For more information about Wills in NSW, see [Trustee and Guardian](https://www.tag.nsw.gov.au/wills-landing-page.html).

### Intestacy: If there isn't a will
<p class="au-callout" aria-label="Callout description1">
 Looking after a person's assets if they don't have a Will can be complicated. For complete information on what happens if there isn't a Will, see [NSW Trustee and Guardian](https://www.tag.nsw.gov.au/intestacy-faq.html. 
</p>

If someone dies without a Will they are said to die 'intestate'. Intestacy can also include the following situations: 
- the Will doesn't properly dispose of all assets
- the Will is either not signed or not witnessed  
- the person did not have mental capacity to make a Will
- the Will has not been written in a way that meets the legal rules for Wills

Sometimes a person may die partly testate and partly intestate. This occurs where part of the Will is valid but part is invalid. This may result in even more inconvenience, delay and expense than administering a full intestate estate.
